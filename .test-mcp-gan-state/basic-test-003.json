The surrounding snippet escapes Markdown backticks, suggesting it may not render as intended. Security risks are minimal given the pure arithmetic, and performance is O(1). To improve, add explicit type checks, JSDoc, finite-number validation, and tests; clarify code block formatting if Markdown is intended.",
