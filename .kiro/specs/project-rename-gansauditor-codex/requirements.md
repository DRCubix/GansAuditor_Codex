# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves renaming the entire project from "GansProject" to "GansAuditor_Codex" to better reflect the tool's new purpose as an integrated auditing and code analysis system. The renaming must be comprehensive, covering all references in code, documentation, configuration files, and project structure while maintaining functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project references to use the new name "GansAuditor_Codex" so that the project identity is consistent and reflects its purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any documentation THEN all references SHALL use "GansAuditor_Codex" instead of "GansProject"
2. WHEN examining package.json THEN the name field SHALL be "gansauditor-codex"
3. WHEN looking at README files THEN all project titles and descriptions SHALL reference "GansAuditor_Codex"
4. WHEN checking configuration files THEN all project identifiers SHALL use the new naming convention

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code references and identifiers to use the new naming convention so that the codebase is internally consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining TypeScript interfaces and types THEN all project-related names SHALL use "GansAuditorCodex" or appropriate variations
2. WHEN reviewing class names and function names THEN project-specific identifiers SHALL reflect the new name
3. WHEN checking import/export statements THEN module names SHALL align with the new project structure
4. WHEN looking at test files THEN all test descriptions and mock data SHALL use the updated naming

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file and directory names to reflect the new project name so that the project structure is intuitive and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the specs directory THEN folder names SHALL use kebab-case variations of the new name
2. WHEN reviewing source files THEN filenames SHALL be updated where they contain project-specific references
3. WHEN checking documentation directories THEN folder and file names SHALL reflect the new project identity
4. IF renaming affects imports THEN all import paths SHALL be updated accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all comments, strings, and documentation to use the new project name so that there are no outdated references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading code comments THEN all project references SHALL use "GansAuditor_Codex"
2. WHEN examining string literals in code THEN project names SHALL be updated appropriately
3. WHEN reviewing JSDoc comments THEN project descriptions SHALL reflect the new name
4. WHEN checking error messages and logs THEN project identifiers SHALL use the updated naming

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the renaming to preserve all existing functionality so that the project continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running existing tests THEN all tests SHALL pass after the rename
2. WHEN building the project THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN using the API THEN all endpoints and responses SHALL function identically
4. WHEN examining git history THEN the rename SHALL be clearly documented in commit messages
