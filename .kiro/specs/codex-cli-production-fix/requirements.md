# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GansAuditor_Codex MCP server currently has unreliable Codex CLI integration that fails in production environments and falls back to mock data. This is unacceptable for a production tool that requires real code analysis. The system must reliably execute Codex CLI commands in all environments, handle timeouts properly, manage working directories correctly, and completely remove mock fallback functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server in production, I want the Codex CLI to execute reliably without falling back to mock data, so that I receive genuine code analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs a code audit THEN it SHALL execute the actual Codex CLI without any mock fallback
2. WHEN Codex CLI execution fails THEN the system SHALL return a proper error response instead of mock data
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL validate that Codex CLI is available and properly configured
4. IF Codex CLI is not available THEN the system SHALL fail fast with a clear error message
5. WHEN audit requests are made THEN the system SHALL NEVER use mock data under any circumstances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Codex CLI integration to handle timeouts gracefully, so that long-running analyses don't hang the system indefinitely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Codex CLI execution exceeds the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL terminate the process and return a timeout error
2. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL log the timeout with relevant context information
3. WHEN configuring timeouts THEN the system SHALL allow environment-specific timeout values
4. WHEN multiple concurrent audits are running THEN each SHALL have independent timeout handling
5. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL clean up any temporary files or processes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Codex CLI to execute in the correct working directory with proper environment variables, so that it can access project files and configurations correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing Codex CLI THEN the system SHALL set the working directory to the repository root
2. WHEN the repository root cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL use the current working directory as fallback
3. WHEN executing Codex CLI THEN the system SHALL preserve all necessary environment variables
4. WHEN running in MCP environment THEN the system SHALL handle environment variable differences correctly
5. WHEN Codex CLI requires specific paths THEN the system SHALL resolve them relative to the working directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for Codex CLI failures, so that I can diagnose and fix integration issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Codex CLI execution fails THEN the system SHALL capture and log the complete error output
2. WHEN Codex CLI is not found THEN the system SHALL provide installation guidance in the error message
3. WHEN Codex CLI returns non-zero exit codes THEN the system SHALL parse and categorize the error types
4. WHEN environment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific diagnostic information
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include context about the attempted operation and environment state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all mock functionality completely removed from the production codebase, so that there's no possibility of accidentally using fake data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is built for production THEN it SHALL contain no mock Codex implementations
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN there SHALL be no conditional logic that enables mock responses
3. WHEN Codex CLI is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fail explicitly rather than using mock data
4. WHEN running tests THEN mock functionality SHALL only be available in test-specific modules
5. WHEN deploying THEN the build process SHALL exclude all mock-related code from production bundles

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want robust process management for Codex CLI execution, so that the system remains stable under various load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing Codex CLI THEN the system SHALL manage child processes properly with cleanup on exit
2. WHEN multiple audits run concurrently THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent Codex processes to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN a process hangs THEN the system SHALL force-kill it after the timeout period
4. WHEN the MCP server shuts down THEN it SHALL terminate all running Codex processes gracefully
5. WHEN process limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue additional requests with appropriate backpressure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of Codex CLI operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Codex CLI executes THEN the system SHALL log the command, arguments, and execution time
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information including environment state
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on execution times and resource usage
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log Codex CLI stdout and stderr
5. WHEN monitoring the system THEN administrators SHALL have access to Codex CLI health metrics
